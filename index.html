        <p>This page compares an audio clip from Protest the Hero's "Bone Marrow" with a song I wrote, comically named "Procure the Dinero" (a.k.a. <em>Get Money</em>).</p>
        <p>The goal is to more closely examine the frequencies involved and see if I can identify contributing factors to tone, harmony, etc.</p>

    <p>The first two images below show a spectrogram overview of 100-1100Hz and 100-3000Hz. There are quite a bit of overtones present, as well as a distinct representation of the base frequencies of the perceived melody.</p>
    <p>Note: Deleting either the overtones <strong>or</strong> the base frequencies has a significant impact on the quality of the guitar tone, which suggests that the overtones are not solely the result of any added effects such as reverberation or detuning.</p>

    <p>In the next two images, sample notes from the measure are examined. They appear to be approximately A5 and E3, a perfect 5th apart.<br>Does the entire melody maintain this exact interval between the two instruments, or does it vary from note to note?<br>Also note that the base frequencies (around the 300-500Hz region) are far less crisp and distinct, which probably contributes to a sloppier sound.</p>

    <p>Just as with Bone Marrow, the first two images show a spectrogram overview of 100-1100Hz and 100-3000Hz. Compared to Bone Marrow, it looks as though there are significantly less amplitude in the overtones, and also somewhat less in the way of subharmonics.<br>To what extent do these contribute to the perceived guitar tone?</p>

    <p>In the next two images, sample notes from the first half of the measure are examined, and while not super in-tune, they appear to be approximately G4 and B3, a 6th apart.<br>Also note that the base frequencies (around the 300-500Hz region) are far less crisp and distinct, which probably contributes to a sloppier sound.</p>

    <p>Similar to the above images, the next two examine a pair of notes from the second half of the measure. They appear to be B3 and B4 â€” one octave apart. This sounds much better, and smoother, even though they are no more crisp or distinct than in the previous examples.<br>I suspect that the interval difference is partly responsibly for failing to replicate the sound from Bone Marrow.</p>
